# Portfolio
This project is my final assignment for Communications Lab course. It showcases my previous work in that class in a cohesive and accessible way.

I found the idea of a website that is clearly divided into sections more appealing and clear than a scrollable website with everything on one page, so I went for a separated look, with navigation buttons accessibly placed on the right side of the window. I did not want to use a lot of text on the website so I tried to include what is necessary and used figures, bars and color contrast to direct the attention of the user. I got inspiration from freeCodingCamp tutorials and videos on YouTube, which also helped me understand the usage of media queries in order to make the website responsive.

An especially appealing part of the website design is the color choices and the light/dark mode with the with on the top-right of the window. Purple and Orange are my favourite colors so I decided to test different shades and ended up with the ones used in the website now. These combinations turned out well because I think they give a premium feel to the webiste, and add an extra element of interactivity in the form of a color mode swicth.

On the portfolio section of the website I tried to use actual images for the blocks that correlate to the project that they lead to, as this conveys the idea of the project better than icons/illustrations. The projects have both a github and a website link to them, so that the user can get a complete understanding of them.

Overall, the website feels uniform and friendly to the audience, with clear showcasing of projects and a multitude of ways to contact me in case of offers on inquiries, which, in my opinion, are the most important aspects of such a website.
